## ðŸ‘‹Overview
You can generate a cover for a playlist based on several parameters: abstraction, image quality (Lo-fi / Hi-fi), and vibe - an alternative to the genre that determines the mood of the music. The algorithm analyzes track titles using ChatGPT and formulates a request to Dalle based on this.
