### Web application for AI-based generation of covers for playlists and music music releases (tracks/albums).

## ðŸ‘‹Overview
You can generate a cover for a playlist based on several parameters: abstraction, image quality (Lo-fi / Hi-fi), and vibe - an alternative to the genre that determines the mood of the music. The algorithm analyzes track titles using ChatGPT and formulates a request to Dalle based on this.

You can also share playlists, sort them by different parameters, add them to your collection, and more.

In addition, the application provides the ability to generate a cover for a track: using a special constructor, which is converted by an internal algorithm into a prompt.
